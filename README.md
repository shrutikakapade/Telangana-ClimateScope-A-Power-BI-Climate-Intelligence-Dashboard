<h1>🌦️ Telangana ClimateScope: A Power BI Climate Intelligence Dashboard</h1>



<h2>📄 Project Description</h2>
<p>
This project leverages Power BI to explore and analyze weather data from 2021 to 2024 across Telangana's districts and mandals. It visualizes patterns in rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed to uncover climate behavior, seasonal shifts, and extreme weather events. These insights aim to support sustainable decision-making in agriculture, disaster management, and climate adaptation planning.
